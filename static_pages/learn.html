    <h1>Here is a breakdown of how stocks work!</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>NVDA Stock Price over the years</h2>
      <img alt="NVDA Price" src="/startup/image/pages/old_nvidia_stock_photo.jpg"/>
      <h4>Above represents the price of the NVDA stock from early 2015 until early 2018</h4>
      <p>
        The price has risen from around $25 per share to more than $230 per share!
        This means that if you were to buy one share at $25 and sell it at $230, you would make
        $205!
      </p>
      <p><b>However</b>, this is not always the case. NOT every stock responds in this way</p>
      <img alt="Market Crash" src="/startup/image/pages/Dow_in_decline.jpg" width="750" height="442"/>
      <h4>Above represents the crash of DOW Industrials</h4>
      <p>
        So if you were to buy this at its peak and sell it at $31,409 
        you would lose a considerable amount of money
      </p>
      <h1>So how can we prevent this?</h1>
